Welcome to the Web-server mountain.

Each folder here will help you trek different webservers, the one's I'd like to pick is Haproxy, Nginx, Apache and Envoy.

### Trek(Level Easy)
First we will trek the normal path which consists of:
- Creating a simple frontend project
  - You can either use a readymade template
  - Or create a simple project
- Now we will start our webserver and try to serve these static files.

### Trek(Level Medium)
It's time to split these components into smaller parts and also add a backend
- The static website now needs some dynamic components
  - Create a cart, or call an API call on click
- Select a backend that is not PHP(No hate it's just too common)
- Setup a backend to run on the host
- Setup the web-server to use the backend.


### Trek(Level Hard)
TBD
